Contributed Software
--------------------

`contrib/` contains interesting or useful software that has been contributed by
the community. The intention is to keep them all in one place which is easily
accessible for users looking to extend `Newsboat`.

Important things to note about `contrib/`:

* Scripts are considered to be experimental and many not work.
* Scripts are not maintained by the Newsboat team.
* Any fixes to scripts should be sent to the original author if available.  If
  the original author is not available, or you would like to contribute a
  script, send a pull request on GitHub or a patch on the [mailing
  list](https://groups.google.com/group/Newsboat) (Newsboat@googlegroups.com).
* Old and obsolete scripts may be removed from time to time.
