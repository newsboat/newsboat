[dependencies.curl-sys]
version = "0.4.5"
# This disables the only default feature, "ssl". It doesn't affect the
# functionality, since it can't affect the libcurl.so available on the host.
#
# curl-sys, like other -sys crates, contains a tarball with the native library
# (i.e. Curl). It first tries to find the compiled library on the host, but if
# it can't, it unpacks the tarball and tries to build the library from source.
# The "ssl" feature of the crate instructs the build to find and link OpenSSL
# (or equivalent). For that, it pulls in openssl-sys crate, which during its
# configuration stage looks for OpenSSL header files.
#
# Since Newsboat requires both Curl and SSL libraries to be already compiled
# and available on the host, we don't need any of this business. In fact,
# openssl-sys introduces an unwanted dependency on OpenSSL headers, which
# exists even if we're linking (via libcurl) against another SSL library like
# GnuTLS. We disable this feature to avoid the dependency.
