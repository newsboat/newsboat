# For pull requests, TRAVIS_BRANCH is the *target* branch, usually "master".
# This leads to mis-assigned coverage reports: they aren't assigned to PR's
# source branch. To combat this, we detect if the build is triggered by a PR,
# and explicitly use PR's source branch if so. That branch might not actually
# exist in our main repo, but that's fine -- Coveralls doesn't check.
#
# Similar distinction exists between TRAVIS_COMMIT and TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_SHA,
# but we don't paper over it there because we *do* want the report to attach to
# the commit that was actually built: this way, we (theoretically) can notice
# if the merge commit affected our coverage somehow.
