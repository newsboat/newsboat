# 2.40 - 2025-06-21

### Added

- `latestunread` feed sort order, which sorts feeds by their most recent unread
    article (#2492) (Daniel Lublin)
- contrib: "monochrome" colorscheme (Halano)

### Changed

- Bumped minimum supported GCC version to GCC 7
- Default `cleanup-on-quit` changed from `yes` to the new option `nudge`, which
    shows a message and waits for a keypress when unreachable items are found in
    the cache. This avoids accidental data loss (#1183) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Updated translations: Chinese (CookiePieWw), Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt),
    German (Lysander Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno),
    Russian and Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev), Spanish (Roboron3042),
    Swedish (Dennis Öberg), Turkish (Emir SARI)
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.83.0
- Updated vendored library json.hpp to 3.12.0

### Removed

- Support for GCC 5 and 6, in line with previous deprecation of compilers that
    don't support C++17

### Fixed

- Crash when invoking `edit-flags` from a new-style binding (i.e. `bind`)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Query feed configs not being read from the urls file when `urls-source` is set
    to `opml` (#3057) (Jorenar)
- Some remote APIs not reading tags from the urls file (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `exec:` and `filter:` feeds could be opened in the browser even though they
    don't have a URL (Juho Eerola)



## 2.39 - 2025-03-23

### Added

- New `bind` command, which is an improvement on both `bind-key` and `macro`.
    It allows multi-key bindings (that's new!) which execute one or more actions
    (similar to macros), and can have a description that'll be displayed in the
    help dialog (that's new too!). It also offers an additional syntax for
    specifying keys: instead of `^R`, one can write `<C-r>`. Multi-key bindings
    are slightly limited in that bindings with same prefix must all be the same
    length to avoid ambiguity when executing them (if I had bindings `for` and
    `fork`, and typed `for`, Newsboat wouldn't know if that's it or I'm going to
    type `k` next) (#1165) (Dennis van der Schagt, Alexander Batischev, Lysander
    Trischler)
- contrib/Newsboat-idlefeeds.sh: a script to show feeds that weren't updated in
    a given amount of time (T3SQ8)

### Changed

- Highlighting in the help form is now case-insensitive (#2998) (Juho Eerola)
- Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt),
    German (Lysander Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno),
    Russian and Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev), Swedish (Dennis Öberg),
    Turkish (Emir SARI)
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.81.0

### Deprecated

- Compilers that don't support C++17. This release compiles with `-std=c++17`,
    but only for compatibility with header files of libicu 75+; Newsboat itself
    only uses C++14 for now. The next release might start using C++17 features,
    so please open an issue if that'll cause problems for you (#3031) (Alexander
    Batischev)

### Removed

- Support for Clang 4, because it doesn't accept `-std=c++17` (#3031) (Alexander
    Batischev)

### Fixed

- Crash when setting a non-existent variable (#2989) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Highlights not displayed for searches that contain less-than sign, due to
    errors in quoting (#3008) (Juho Eerola)
- Building with libicu 75+, which requires C++17. libicu is an indirect
    dependency of Newsboat via libxml2 (#3031) (Alexander Batischev)



## 2.38 - 2024-12-22

Lists below only mention user-visible changes, but the full list of contributors
for this release also includes Juho Eerola.

### Added

- Shell completions for ZSH (Ludovico Gerardi)
- Keymap hint for "Clear filter" when filter is active (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Better logs when Miniflux authentication fails with something other than
    401 Unauthorized (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Support for enclosures with Miniflux (Anshul Gupta)

### Changed

- Shell completions are now installed into directories where shells are looking
    for them. Previously, completions were installed into doc/contrib (Ludovico
    Gerardi)
- Updated translations: Chinese (CookiePieWw), Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt),
    German (Lysander Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno),
    Russian and Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev), Spanish (Roboron3042),
    Swedish (Dennis Öberg), Turkish (Emir SARI)
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.79.0

### Fixed

- `MKDIR` not being used in all the relevant places of the Makefile (Ludovico
    Gerardi)
- Dates far in the past or the future not being stored correctly (#2871) (Dennis
    van der Schagt)
- `cookie-cache` having not effect on `reload-all` (bound to `R` by default,
    also activated by `auto-reload`) (#2935) (Dennis van der Schagt)



## 2.37 - 2024-09-22

### Added

- contrib: a bookmark plugin for Readeck (Ada Wildflower)
- Podboat: podcasts can now be "missing", meaning a file was downloaded by
    Podboat but removed by some other program (Dennis van der Schagt)
- contrib: completions file for fish shell (Dennis van der Schagt)

### Changed

- Sped up `-x reload` a little by grouping feeds on the same domain. Other ways
    to trigger a reload already had this optimization (Juho Eerola)
- Sped up FreshRSS integration with regard to marking articles as read
    (fjebaker)
- Updated translations: Chinese (CookiePieWw), Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt),
    German (Lysander Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno),
    Russian and Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev), Spanish (Roboron3042), Turkish
    (Emir SARI)
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.77.0
- Updated vendored library Catch2 to 3.7.0 (Alexander Batischev)

### Fixed

- Newsboat spamming sites with requests when `download-retries` is changed from
    its default of 1 and the site returns HTTP code 304 Not Modified (#2732)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Crash on articles with combining Unicode characters (#2805) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
- Crash on articles where author name ends in a closing parenthesis (Mikhail
    Yumanov)
- Cursor highlighting the wrong list entry after the terminal was resized
    (#2845) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `highlight-article` with expressions that contain flags had no effect on
    unread articles (#2814) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- "Searching..." message not disappearing when the search is over (#2837)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)

    (Dennis van der Schagt)

### Changed

- Improved readability of `--help`: better alignment, replace unreadable ad hoc
    filenames with `<file>` (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Updated translations: Brazilian Portuguese (André L. C. Moreira),
    Chinese (CookiePieWw), Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander

## 2.35 - 2024-03-24

Lists below only mention user-visible changes, but the full list of contributors
for this release also includes Daniel Oh and Lucio Sauer.

### Added

- Support for Feedbin (#716) (James Vaughan)
- `--queue-file`, `--search-history-file`, and `--cmdline-history-file` options
    to specify locations of the respective files. This, along with the existing
    options `--url-file`, `--config-file`, and `--cache-file`, lets the user
    fully customize the locations instead of relying on XDG or dotfiles (#57)
    (CookiePieWw)
- `miniflux-flag-star` setting, so articles flagged in Newsboat appear as
    starred in Miniflux (#2235) (gilcu3)
- `miniflux-show-special-feeds` setting (enabled by default) which adds a "Starred
    Items" feed to the feedlist for those two use Miniflux (gilcu3)
- Podboat: if `--log-level` is specified but `--log-file` isn't, write the log
    to a file named after the template `Podboat_%Y-%m-%d_%H.%M.%S.log`, i.e. use
    the current date and time. The same functionality was added to Newsboat
    proper in 2.31 (Dennis van der Schagt)
- contrib: a bookmark plugin for Linkding (Mike Hall)
- contrib: a bookmark plugin for Wallabag (Mike Hall)
- contrib: a filter to turn twtxt protocol into RSS (Cyril Augier)
- contrib: a filter to add newlines to Slashdot feed (Dennis van der Schagt)

### Changed

- Build in C++14 mode. This does *not* increase our requirements for compilers,
    because the ones we require already provide C++14 support
- Updated translations: Chinese (CookiePieWw), Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt),
    German (Lysander Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno),
    Russian and Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev), Swedish (deob83),
    Turkish (Emir SARI)
- Updated vendored library optional-lite to 3.6.0
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.72.1

### Fixed

- `%>[char]` format not working inside a conditional format
    (e.g. `%D %?T?%-63t%> %T&%t?`) (#2645) (Juho Eerola)



## 2.34 - 2023-12-25

Lists below only mention user-visible changes, but the full list of contributors
for this release also includes bogdasar1985, who made quite a few changes to
Newsboat internals (and continues work on even more!).

### Added

- `latest_article_age` feed attribute; it's similar to the `age` attribute of an
    article, and can be used to e.g. hide feeds which were recently updated
    (#2619) (Dennis van der Schagt)

### Changed

- Updated translations: Chinese (CookiePieWw), Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt),
    German (Lysander Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno),
    Russian and Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev)
- Updated vendored library json.hpp to 3.11.3
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.70.0

### Fixed

- Articles in Mastodon feeds having no titles when using Newsboat with NextCloud
    News (#2573) (Dennis van der Schagt)



## 2.33 - 2023-09-24

### Added

- Support for `0`..`9` keys in dialog overview. If you never used dialog
    overview, it's invoked by `V` key by default and is very useful if you also
    employ `^V`/`^G`/`^X` to keep multiple dialogs open within Newsboat (Dennis
    van der Schagt)
- Support importing OPML 2.0 with `--import-from-opml` (#2448) (bogdasar1985)

### Changed

- Image enclosures are now displayed at the start of the article. This improves
    support for Mastodon feeds (#2305, #2495) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- In feeds that lack title and whose URLs end entirely in digits, use the
    description as a title instead. This improves support for Mastodon feeds and
    hopefully doesn't break others (#2530) (Martin Vilcans)
- Taught contrib/image-preview/nbrun to take Newsboat's CLI arguments (venomega)
- Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander
    Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno), Russian and Ukrainian
    (Alexander Batischev), Spanish (Roboron3042), Swedish (Dennis Öberg),
    Turkish (Emir SARI)
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.68.2

### Fixed

- Hanging if scripts used by `filter:`, `bookmark-cmd`, or `html-renderer`
    process their input in a streaming fashion rather than reading it entirely
    before outputting anything (Alexander Batischev)
- Slowness in opening and navigating feeds that contain many items (#229)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `--export-to-opml` producing invalid OPML documents (missing `text` attribute)
    (#2518) (bogdasar1985)



## 2.32 - 2023-06-25

### Added

- contrib: a filter to remove Substack's "Subscribe now" prompts from the posts
    (NunoSempere)
- contrib: an image pager which can spot all the images in a post and display
    them with either `feh` or `kitty`'s `icat` (whyrgola)
- Tags in OPML export. This is implemented as a new option, `--export-to-opml2`,
    because the output format is OPML version 2.0 rather than the 1.0 that
    `--export-to-opml` produces. We intend to make OPML 2.0 the default in some
    future major release of Newsboat (#871) (Gwyneth Morgan)

### Changed

- Enclosures are only enqueued if their MIME type looks like a podcast or is
    empty. This prevents Newsboat from e.g. enqueueing images from Mastodon
    feeds (#2367) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Asciidoctor is a truly optional dependency now. `make all` still builds docs,
    but at least one can `make Newsboat` and such without installing Asciidoctor
    (#2353) (Alexander Batischev)
- Newlines are now removed from the author's name (#2434) (blankie)
- If the same URL is used in `<a>` and/or `<img>`/`<iframe>`, it's marked as
    "image" or "iframe" rather than simply a "link" (#2432) (blankie)
- `goto-title` operation now searches for the titles *as you see them*, i.e. if
    a feed doesn't have a title and Newsboat displays its URL instead,
    `goto-feed` will use that URL rather than the (empty) title (#2451)
    (blankie)
- Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander
    Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno), Russian and Ukrainian
    (Alexander Batischev), Swedish (Dennis Öberg), Turkish (Emir SARI)
- Updated vendored library expected-lite to 0.6.3
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.66.1

### Fixed

- Detection of Cargo and Asciidoctor: it succeeded even if these programs were
    missing (Alexander Batischev)



## 2.31 - 2023-03-26

Lists below only mention user-visible changes, but the full list of contributors
for this release also includes: Sergei Trofimovich and giuliano.

### Added

- Operations for scrolling by half a page (`halfpageup`, `halfpagedown`) (#36)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
- If `--log-level` is specified but `--log-file` isn't, write the log to a file
    named after the template `Newsboat_%Y-%m-%d_%H.%M.%S.log`, i.e. use the
    current date and time (Dennis van der Schagt)
- _contrib/move_url.py_ for moving feeds in Newsboat's database while keeping
    articles (blankie)

### Changed

- Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander
    Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno), Russian and Ukrainian
    (Alexander Batischev), Spanish (Roboron3042), Turkish (Emir SARI)
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.64.0

### Fixed

- Inability to exit search mode when `quit` is bound to `BACKSPACE` (#2336)
    (Dennis van der Schagt, Alexander Batischev)



## 2.30.1 - 2022-12-30

### Fixed

- Build failure with curl 7.87.

  It was caused by us using a deprecated curl constant, which in 7.87 started
  emitting a warning. Since we turn warnings into errors (-Werror), this failed
  the build. This wasn't spotted by our CI because curl 7.87 only came out a few
  days before Newsboat 2.30 did, and our CI uses Ubuntu LTS which doesn't pull
  updates *that* fast.

  The fix replaces the deprecated constant with a newer one. This also required
  a bump of minimum supported curl version from 7.21.6 (released 16 June 2010)
  to 7.32.0 (released 11 August 2013), which shouldn't affect anyone because of
  how low the new requirement is.

  (#2297) (Dennis van der Schagt)



## 2.30 - 2022-12-25

Lists below only mention user-visible changes, but the full list of contributors
for this release also includes: Arttano, Danny Kirkham, Juho Eerola, and Pepe
Doval.

### Added

- In config, long lines can now be broken into multiple ones with `\`. When
    parsing the config, Newsboat would remove the backslash and append the
    following line to the current one. Be careful when indenting the lines that
    follow the backslash, as the indentation will be included in the
    concatenated string; this can change the meaning of some commands, e.g. if
    the indentation ends up inside a regex (#2212) (Simon Farre)
- `article-feed` operation, to go to the feed of the currently selected article.
    This can come in handy in query feeds (phire)
- New placeholder for `browser`, `%T`, which is replaced by the title of the
    selected feed or item (#2224) (Aneesh)
- Miniflux: fail on startup if credentials are wrong (#2220) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
- Miniflux: support for API token authentication, which is available since
    Miniflux 2.0.21 and is the preferred authentication method:
    https://miniflux.app/docs/api.html#authentication See `miniflux-token`,
    `miniflux-tokeneval`, and `miniflux-tokenfile` settings (#2122) (Dennis van
    der Schagt)

### Changed

- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.62.0
- When `cleanup-on-quit` is disabled and the cache contains unreachable feeds,
    print their number, and write their URLs to `error-log` (#1548) (Maximilian
    Winkler)
- If an item contains enclosure(s) but doesn't specify their type(s), pick the
    last one (as Newsboat only displays a single enclosure per item). This won't
    always do the right thing, e.g. it could pick cover art instead of the
    podcast, but *sometimes* it will, so it's still better than nothing (#2050)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander
    Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno), Russian (Alexander
    Batischev), Turkish (Emir SARI), Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev)
- Updated vendored library Catch2 to 2.13.10

### Fixed

- Atom: if an item doesn't specify the `atom:author`, use the field from the
    contained `atom:source`; if that's not specified either, use `atom:author`
    of the feed itself. This is dictated by RFC 4287 §4.2.1 (#2256) (Lysander
    Trischler)

### Security

- Remove transitive dependency on the vulnerable `time` 0.1 crate:
    CVE-2020-26235 https://osv.dev/vulnerability/RUSTSEC-2020-0071 (#2288)
    (Alexander Batischev, thanks to the prod from critkitten)



## 2.29 - 2022-09-25

### Added

- New placeholder for `browser`, `%t`, which is replaced by the type of the URL
    (#1954) (blank X)
- contrib: a script to reorder lines in the `urls` file (#1918) (T3SQ8)
- Support for Brotli compression. In fact, Newsboat will now use all the methods
    supported by the libcurl it's linked to (#2152) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- In tags dialog, put the cursor on the currently selected tag, or the first tag
    if none is selected at the moment (#2093) (Dennis van der Schagt)

### Changed

- When rendering an article, put a newline between consecutive `<audio>` and
    `<video>` tags (#2103) (blank X)
- When `select-filter` is used with an argument (e.g. from a macro), that
  argument is now used to look up a predefined filter by name. The old
  behaviour (applying the argument as filter) is still available by using
  `set-filter` instead (#2137) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- When `select-filter` is used without an argument, it will now open the filter
  selection dialog. Previously, `set-filter` from a macro without arguments
  was ignored in the article list (#2137) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Docs: use a new style for keys. It should be more readable than the old one,
    please file issues if you disagree! (#2028) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- When reloading feeds in parallel, status line now shows the progress rather
    than the number of the currently reloaded feed (#2065) (Juho Eerola)
- Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), French (Tonus), German
    (Lysander Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno), Russian and
    Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev), Spanish (Roboron3042), Turkish (Emir SARI)
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.59.0
- Bumped minimum supported GNU Make version to 4.0 (released on
    October 9th, 2013)
- Updated vendored libraries: expected-lite to 0.6.2, json.hpp to 3.11.2

### Fixed

- Segfault on `sqlite3DbMallocRawNN` (#1980) (Juho Eerola)
- Scrolling when toggling `show-read-feeds` (#2138) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Feeds not reloading in parallel when reloading only visible feeds (#2067)

## 2.28 - 2022-06-26

Lists below only mention user-visible changes, but the full list of contributors
for this release also includes: Jan Staněk, blank X, and sebashwa.

### Added

- Ability to go back to the previous set of search results. This introduces
    a new dialog, `searchresultslist`, which supports a new operation,
    `previoussearchresults` (bound to `z` key by default). The
    `searchresult-title-format` setting now supports one more placeholder, `%s`,
    which is replaced by the term you searched for (#1785, #2043) (bogdasar1985)
- Support for `enqueue` operation in the article list (#2023) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
- New placeholder for `articlelist-format`, `%e`, which is replaced by the URL
    of the article's enclosure (#2023) (Dennis van der Schagt)

### Changed

- If an article has multiple links, `open-in-browser` will open the HTTP or
    HTTPS one. If article has no such links, then the last one to appear in the
    feed's source is picked. (Note: this is about the link that you see in the
    item's header, prefixed by "Link:" -- NOT about the links in the article
    itself) (#2060) (bogdasar1985)
- Updated translations: Brazilian Portuguese (Alexandre Provencio), Dutch
    (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander Trischler), Italian (Mauro
    Scomparin), Polish (Michał Siemek), Russian, Ukrainian (Alexander
    Batischev), Spanish (Roboron3042), Turkish (Emir SARI)
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.57.0
- Updated vendored library Catch2 to 2.13.9, expected-lite to 0.6.0

### Removed

- Snap: i386 support. The package is now based on Ubuntu 20.04, which doesn't
    support i386 (#2058)

### Fixed

- Stop scrolling to top of article when window is resized (#1298) (Dennis van
    der Schagt)
- NextCloud News 18.1.0+: crashes when reloading feeds that have no author or
    title (#2102) (Alexander Batischev)
- Snap: "Error opening terminal: xterm-kitty". This fix comes at the cost of
    i386 support in Snap (#2058) (Gianluca Della Vedova, Alexander Batischev)



## 2.27 - 2022-03-22

### Added

- Support for regexes in `ignore-article`; for example, you can now use
    `ignore-article "https://nitter.net/.*" "title =~ \"RT by\""` to ignore all
    retweets in your Nitter feeds. This is more efficient than matching on
    `feedurl` from the filter expression, because this new form is only
    evaluated for the feeds that match the regex, while the old form would run
    for all articles of all feeds (#1913) (duarm)
- A "universal" color scheme (Yurii H)
- A user-contributed script to show images in Kitty terminal emulator:
    contrib/kitty-img-pager.sh (Timm Heuss)
- Support for XDG directories in contrib/exportOPMLWithTags.py (frogtile)

### Changed

- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.55.0
- We now link to our own STFL fork: https://github.com/Newsboat/stfl. The
    upstream's SVN is down, and we never managed to get any of our bugfixes in
    there anyway. Since we seem to be the last remaining STFL user, we advise
    downstream maintainers to rely on our repo instead. Our fork is maintained to
    the extent necessary for Newsboat
- In manpages, command line options are now set in bold and are underlined,
    while inline code is underlined. These changes improve readability (Lysander
    Trischler)
- Clarified error messages in OPML import (#1919) (bogdasar1985)
- Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), French (Tonus), German
    (Lysander Trischler), Hungarian (maxigaz), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish
    (Michał Siemek), Russian, Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev), Spanish (Roboron3042),
    Turkish (Emir SARI)
- Updated vendored library json.hpp to 3.10.5, Catch2 to 2.13.8

### Fixed

- Cursor jumping too far after marking a feed read when hidden feeds are present
    (#1934) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Newsboat exiting with code 0 when OPML import fails (bogdasar1985)
- XML entities not being decoded in "text/plain" entries (#1938) (bogdasar1985)
- Crash when "ol" or "ul" tags are closed multiple times (#1974) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
- Confirmation and Q&A text being almost invisible with "nord" color scheme
    (Daryl Manning)
- Some invalid code in contrib/exportOPMLWithTags.py (frogtile)
- Blank lines inside tags not being preserved when inside a "pre" tag (#2003)
    (blank X)
- A potential crash in HTML entities decoding code (blank X)

### Security

- Addressed CVE-2022-24713 (a.k.a. RUSTSEC-2022-0013) by updating "regex" crate
    to 1.5.5 (#2008) (Alexander Batischev)

    van der Schagt)

### Fixed

- Starred items not being synchronized to NextCloud News (#743) (Dennis van der

Lists below only mention user-visible changes, but the full list of contributors
for this release also includes: Amrit Brar, noctux, and shenlebantongying.

### Added

- New elements to style with `color` command: `title`, `hint-key`,
    `hint-keys-delimiter`, `hint-separator`, and `hint-description`. If there is
    no style for one of those elements, the style of `info` is used instead. See
    "Configuring Colors" section in the docs (Alexander Batischev)
- Podboat: show an error when a podcast can't be renamed (#545) (Kartikeya
    Gupta)
- A note that the urls file can contain comments (Lysander Trischler)

### Changed

- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.51.0
- Key hints (at the bottom of the screen) are now styled to make them easier to
    read. If you're using a custom colorscheme and want to use these new
    elements, you need to update it; see the "Configuring Colors" section in the
    docs (#1016) (Alexander Batischev)
- Podboat: move to the next item after marking a podcast finished or deleted
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `purge-deleted` now keeps the cursor near where it was in the list, rather
    than the *line* it was on (#1728) (Allan Wind)
- Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander
    Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Michał Siemek), Russian,
    Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev), and Turkish (Emir Sari)

    (Alexander Batischev)
- Slow scrolling in Podboat (#1375) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Slow `mark-all-read` with remote APIs. It's still slow when a filter is
    applied, but without a filter it's as fast as possible (Alexander Batischev)
- A crash when `next-unread` is invoked while viewing a tag with no unread feeds
    (#1734) (Alexander Batischev)
- A crash on feeds that contain wide characters (e.g. emojis) (mcz)



## 2.24 - 2021-06-20

for this release also includes Alexandre Alapetite.

### Added

- FreshRSS support (Petra Lamborn)
- Ability to add descriptions to macros (#228) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Support for plain-text Atom entries (YouTube is the most prominent publisher
    of those) (#468, #1022, #1010) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `restrict-filename` setting to control if non-alphanumeric symbols will get
    replaced by underscores when saving an article (#1110) (crimsonskylark)
- `highlight-feed` setting to highlight feedlist entries according to the filter
    expressions (same as `highlight-article` in the article list) (#1510)
    (Vonter)

### Changed

- IRC channel moved from Freenode to Libera.Chat network
- Newsboat will now fail to start if settings are passed more parameters than
    they expect. To fix this, read the doc for the setting and try using double
    quotes as necessary (Alexander Batischev)
- Newsboat will now quit if you try to open a query feed whose expression
    contains an unknown attribute. This is a temporary workaround; the next
    version will display an error instead. The proper fix couldn't be added to
    2.24 because that'd disrupt the freeze on translations (#1665) (Dennis van
    der Schagt)
- Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander
    Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Michał Siemek), Russian
    (Alexander Batischev), Turkish (Emir Sari), Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev)
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.48.0

### Fixed

    deleted (#1546) (Dennis van der Schagt)

    out, or read ones when `show-read-articles` is in effect) (#1364) (Dennis
    van der Schagt)
- Supplying garbage instead of a correct Newsboat version to FeedHQ and The Old
    Reader (Alexander Batischev)
- Sorting in ascending order partially reversing the results of the previous
    sort (#1561) (tau3)
- Compile errors when building with a stack protector (#1598) (Alexander
    Batischev)
- `toggle-article-read` ignoring its argument in macros when executed from an
    article view (#1637) (ysh16)
- Article view scrolling back to top after opening a link (#1463) (Dennis van
    der Schagt)
- The build system trying to find `iconv()` in libc instead of linking with
    libiconv (Theo Buehler)



## 2.23 - 2021-03-21

Lists below only mention user-visible changes, but the full list of contributors
for this release also includes: John Jarvis, Nicholas Defranco, and Raphael
Nestler.

### Added

- `open-in-browser-noninteractively` operation which is similar to
    `open-in-browser`, but doesn't relinquish the terminal to the browser. It
    still waits for the browser to finish executing, though (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
- Confirmation for `delete-all-articles`. It's enabled by default, but can be
    disabled with `confirm-delete-all-articles no`. (#1490) (Amrit Brar)

    in the queue. If that happens, you'll have to adjust
    `download-filename-format` to make the filenames more distinguishable
    (#1411) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Reduced message flickering when reloading feeds (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander
    Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno), Russian (Alexander
    Batischev), Turkish (Emir Sari), and Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev)
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.46.0
- Updated vendored library Catch2 to 2.13.4

### Removed

- `dumpform` command-line command which was only intended for debugging
    (Dennis van der Schagt)

### Fixed

- Missing empty lines inside `pre` tags (#1429) (Alexander Batischev)
- `open-all-unread-in-browser-and-mark-read` not synchronizing the "read" status
    to the remote API (#1449) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Newsboat redrawing the screen once a minute even if idle (#563) (Dennis van
    der Schagt)
- `delete-all-articles` no longer deletes items that aren't visible (e.g.
    because of `ignore-mode display`) (#1360) (Alexander Batischev)
- Slashes are now replaced by underscores when generating a podcast filename
    (#836) (Dennis van der Schagt)

    Schagt)



## 2.22.1 - 2021-01-10

### Fixed

- Slow scrolling in the article list (regression) (#1372) (Alexander Batischev)
- Segfaults if `swap-title-and-hints` is enabled (regression) (#1399) (Dennis
    van der Schagt)
- Build failure on GCC 9 due to `maybe-uninitialized` warning which `-Werror`
    turns into an error (Alexander Batischev)
- Articlelist's title not being updated when moving to the next unread feed
    (#1385) (Alexander Batischev)



## 2.22 - 2020-12-21

Lists below only mention user-visible changes, but the full list of contributors
for this release also includes David Brito and panvicka.

### Added

- `confirm-mark-all-feeds-read` setting, which makes Newsboat ask for
    confirmation before marking all the feeds as read (#1215) (Tarishi Jain)
- Command line autocompletion in the save dialog (#893) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Support for ^U, ^K, ^G, and ^W editing keys (as in readline and Emacs) in
    command line in the save dialog (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Support for RSS Media extension in Atom feeds (#595) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- New, more detailed, documentation chapters on macros and running external
    commands (A1RO)
- User-contributed script that exports feeds with their tags in the OPML format:
    contrib/exportOPMLWithTags.py (jartigag)

    Schagt)

    (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `--cleanup` command-line flag, which does the same as `cleanup-on-quit`
    option (#1182) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `check` and `ci-check` Makefile targets. Both run C++ and Rust test suites
    consecutively, but the former fails early. Use `check` locally where
    re-running tests is quick, and use `ci-check` in CI where re-running tests
    usually means re-building everything first (#896) (Alexander Batischev)
- Command line support in the help dialog (Dennis van der Schagt)
- "(localized)" marks in documentation for all settings with internationalized
    default values (#1270) (Amrit Brar)
- `%F` placeholder in `browser` setting, which is *always* replaced by the
    feed's URL (unlike `%u`, which depends on the context in which the browser
    is invoked) (#423) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Dumping of `ignore-article` rules with `dumpconfig` command (in Newsboat's
    internal command line) (#635) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `%L` placeholder in `datetime-format` setting, which turns into "X days ago"
    string explaining when the article was published (#1323) (Amrit Brar)
- Support for escaped double quotes in arguments to `set` operation when used in
    macros (#1345) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Podboat: error message if the podcast file can't be written onto disk (#1209)
    (Nicholas Defranco)

### Changed

- Abort startup if the urls file or config file is not in UTF-8 encoding. This
    limitation was effectively in place for a couple releases already, but
    Newsboat crashed instead of displaying an error message. We intend to relax
    the requirement again, but for now, we choose to be upfront about it rather
    than crashing (#723, #844) (Dennis van der Schagt, Alexander Batischev)
- `save-all` operation no longer provides "yes for all" and "no for all" options
    when there is only one conflict to resolve (#657) (saleh)
- Config parser now allows to have tab characters between `macro` arguments;
    they will be treated as space (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.44.0
- Updated vendored libraries: Catch2 to 2.13.3, martinmoene/optional-lite
    to 3.4.0, martinmoene/expected-lite to 0.5.0
- Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), French (tkerdonc), German
    (Lysander Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno), Russian
    (Alexander Batischev), Turkish (Emir Sarı), Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev)

### Fixed

    Schagt)
- Misleading error message when the urls file exists, but can't be opened (#439)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Newsboat processing the leftovers of `stdin` after running `open-in-browser`
    operation (#26, #63, #1094) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `mark-feed-read` operation not marking articles as read on a remote service
    when the operation is invoked in the query feed (#220) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
- `run-on-startup` setting preventing Podboat from starting (#1288) (Dennis van
    der Schagt)
- `scrolloff` setting being ignored when opening a feed with lots of read
    articles before the unread one (#1293) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Memory corruption while rendering an article with JavaScript that contains
    HTML (#1300) (Alexander Batischev)
- Podboat help dialog crashing if `BACKSPACE` is bound (#1139) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
- Being unable to run a second Newsboat instance with `--cache-file` switch if
    `cache-file` setting is used (#1318) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Misleading "an instance is already running" message when a lock file can't be
    created or written to (#314) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Failing to parse macros which contain semicolons in operations' arguments
    (#1200) (Alexander Batischev)
- Not installing some of the contrib scripts (Alexander Batischev)
- `Newsboat -x` not reporting that another instance is already running (#483)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Itemlist refreshing while a macro is executing, causing the macro to operate
    on the wrong items (#70) (Dennis van der Schagt)

- `run-on-startup` setting which executes a given list of operations when

## 2.20.1 - 2020-06-24

### Fixed
- Installation on BSDs (Tobias Kortkamp)
- Regression that caused Newsboat to require a space before semicolon in macros,
    which made `set browser "lynx"; open-in-browser` invalid (#1013, #1015,

- The conditional format sequence (`%?[char]?[format]&[format]?`) now treats
    whitespace-only value as empty. This allows changing the formatting of, for
    example, "unread" and "deleted" fields in articlelist-format (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
- `open-in-browser-and-mark-read` in feedlist no longer marks articles read if
  the browser fails (Nikos Tsipinakis)
- Macro execution halts if one of the operations fails (Nikos Tsipinakis)

    (pi.scateu.me)
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.40.0
- Updated vendored libraries: Catch2 to 2.12.2, json.hpp to 3.8.0

### Removed
- Newsboat's Inoreader API keys. Users need to register their own Inoreader
    application now, and set them via `inoreader-app-id` and `inoreader-app-key`
    settings. Please see "Inoreader" section in the HTML documentation for
    details. (Alexander Batischev)

### Fixed
- Help dialog showing operations as unbound even though they *are* bound to some
    keys (#843) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `feedlink` attribute containing feed title instead of feed URL (Alexander
    Batischev)
- `feeddate` attribute containing fixed string instead of item's publication
    date and time (Alexander Batischev)
- `browser` setting not working if it contains `<` (#917) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
- `up`, `down`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `home`, and `end` now working in macros
    (#890) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Backslash inside double quotes requiring three escapes instead of one, every
    other time (#536, #642, #926) (Alexander Batischev)
- Users can bind operations to `UP`, `DOWN`, `HOME`, `END`, `NPAGE`, and `PPAGE`
    keys (#903) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Generate example config as part of `doc` target, so `install-examples` can
    simply copy it instead of generating (Alexander Batischev)
- Install manpages via `install-docs` target, not `install-Newsboat` and
    `install-Podboat` (#829) (Alexander Batischev)
- The wrong feed being opened (#72) turned out to be caused by a bug in libstfl.
    A patch for that library is available at
    https://github.com/dennisschagt/stfl/pull/4#issuecomment-613640246 (Dennis
    van der Schagt)



## 2.19 - 2020-03-22

Lists below only mention user-visible changes, but I would also like to
acknowledge contributions from the following people: Ivan Tham, Merlin Büge,
Raphael Nestler, and Tobias Kortkamp.

This is the last release to support Rust 1.26.0. Starting with Newsboat 2.20,
we will be supporting only the last five stable Rust compilers (at the time of
the release), e.g. Newsboat 2.20 will only support Rust 1.40, 1.41, 1.42, 1.43,
1.44 (which should be the current stable at the time of Newsboat 2.20 release).
Please see https://github.com/Newsboat/Newsboat/issues/709 for more details on
this decision.

### Added
- contrib/urls-maintenance.sh: a script that converts HTTP to HTTPS, updates
    URLs according to HTTP redirects etc. (velaja)
- `delete-played-files` setting (#669) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `%K` format for  `podlist-format`. This format specifier is replaced by the
  human readable download speed (automatically switches between KB/s, MB/s, and
  GB/s) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Docs on how to synchronize with Bazqux (Jonathan Siddle, Alexander Batischev)
- Document that regexes use POSIX extended regular expressions
- Document that regexes in filter language are case-insensitive

- Display `<audio>` and `<video>` tags in article view (Ignacio Losiggio)
- Update translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander

- `podlist-format` now uses `%K` instead of `%k` by default (shows human
    readable speed instead of always using KB/s) (#727) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- contrib/pinboard.pl: save description of the article (Donald Merand)
- The EOT markers ("~" characters below blocks of text) no longer inherit their
  style (colors + attributes) from the "article" style. Instead, they can be
  configured separately, allowing to hide them without hiding the article text
  (example config line: `color end-of-text-marker default default invis`) (#507)
  (Dennis van der Schagt)

### Fixed
- **Breaking change**: `bind-key` context `podbeuter` renamed to `Podboat`
    (Alexander Batischev) (Kudos to Marcos Cruz)

    Default is the same as older versions of Podboat (Jagannathan Tiruvallur
