Lists below only mention user-visible changes, but the full list of contributors
for this release also includes: John Jarvis, Nicholas Defranco, and Raphael
Nestler.

### Added

- `open-in-browser-noninteractively` operation which is similar to
    `open-in-browser`, but doesn't relinquish the terminal to the browser. It
    still waits for the browser to finish executing, though (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
- Confirmation for `delete-all-articles`. It's enabled by default, but can be
    disabled with `confirm-delete-all-articles no`. (#1490) (Amrit Brar)
- `%U` specifier for `feedlist-title-format` which shows the total number of
    unread articles in all feeds (#1495) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Display images' alternate text in the article view (#1512)
    (Mark A. Matney, Jr)
- List `iframe` URLs in the article view (#1153) (Mark A. Matney, Jr)

### Changed

- Newsboat now refuses to enqueue a podcast if its filename is already present
    in the queue. If that happens, you'll have to adjust
    `download-filename-format` to make the filenames more distinguishable
    (#1411) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Reduced message flickering when reloading feeds (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander
    Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno), Russian (Alexander
    Batischev), Turkish (Emir Sari), and Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev)
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.46.0
- Updated vendored library Catch2 to 2.13.4

### Removed

- `dumpform` command-line command which was only intended for debugging
    (Dennis van der Schagt)

### Fixed

- Missing empty lines inside `pre` tags (#1429) (Alexander Batischev)
- `open-all-unread-in-browser-and-mark-read` not synchronizing the "read" status
    to the remote API (#1449) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Newsboat redrawing the screen once a minute even if idle (#563) (Dennis van
    der Schagt)
- `delete-all-articles` no longer deletes items that aren't visible (e.g.
    because of `ignore-mode display`) (#1360) (Alexander Batischev)
- Slashes are now replaced by underscores when generating a podcast filename
    (#836) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- File- and dirbrowsers no longer produce invalid paths when user navigates with
    arrow keys (#1418) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Successful OPML import is no longer misreported as an error (Alexander
    Batischev)
- Descriptions in the help dialog are localized again (#1471) (Emir Sari)
- Added a newline after each `div`, since it's a block element (#1405)
    (Alexander Batischev)
- Re-introduce `set x!` (toggle) and `set x&` (reset) (#1491) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)



## 2.22.1 - 2021-01-10

### Fixed

- Slow scrolling in the article list (regression) (#1372) (Alexander Batischev)
- Segfaults if `swap-title-and-hints` is enabled (regression) (#1399) (Dennis
    van der Schagt)
- Build failure on GCC 9 due to `maybe-uninitialized` warning which `-Werror`
    turns into an error (Alexander Batischev)
- Articlelist's title not being updated when moving to the next unread feed
    (#1385) (Alexander Batischev)



## 2.22 - 2020-12-21

Lists below only mention user-visible changes, but the full list of contributors
for this release also includes David Brito and panvicka.

### Added

- `confirm-mark-all-feeds-read` setting, which makes Newsboat ask for
    confirmation before marking all the feeds as read (#1215) (Tarishi Jain)
- Command line autocompletion in the save dialog (#893) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Support for ^U, ^K, ^G, and ^W editing keys (as in readline and Emacs) in
    command line in the save dialog (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Support for RSS Media extension in Atom feeds (#595) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- New, more detailed, documentation chapters on macros and running external
    commands (A1RO)
- User-contributed script that exports feeds with their tags in the OPML format:
    contrib/exportOPMLWithTags.py (jartigag)
- Help dialog in the URLs view (#1218) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Handling of terminal resizes for all dialogs (#389, #390) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)

    (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `--cleanup` command-line flag, which does the same as `cleanup-on-quit`
    option (#1182) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `check` and `ci-check` Makefile targets. Both run C++ and Rust test suites
    consecutively, but the former fails early. Use `check` locally where
    re-running tests is quick, and use `ci-check` in CI where re-running tests
    usually means re-building everything first (#896) (Alexander Batischev)
- Command line support in the help dialog (Dennis van der Schagt)
- "(localized)" marks in documentation for all settings with internationalized
    default values (#1270) (Amrit Brar)
- `%F` placeholder in `browser` setting, which is *always* replaced by the
    feed's URL (unlike `%u`, which depends on the context in which the browser
    is invoked) (#423) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Dumping of `ignore-article` rules with `dumpconfig` command (in Newsboat's
    internal command line) (#635) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `%L` placeholder in `datetime-format` setting, which turns into "X days ago"
    string explaining when the article was published (#1323) (Amrit Brar)
- Support for escaped double quotes in arguments to `set` operation when used in
    macros (#1345) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Podboat: error message if the podcast file can't be written onto disk (#1209)
    (Nicholas Defranco)

### Changed

- Abort startup if the urls file or config file is not in UTF-8 encoding. This
    limitation was effectively in place for a couple releases already, but
    Newsboat crashed instead of displaying an error message. We intend to relax
    the requirement again, but for now, we choose to be upfront about it rather
    than crashing (#723, #844) (Dennis van der Schagt, Alexander Batischev)
- `save-all` operation no longer provides "yes for all" and "no for all" options
    when there is only one conflict to resolve (#657) (saleh)
- Config parser now allows to have tab characters between `macro` arguments;
    they will be treated as space (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.44.0
- Updated vendored libraries: Catch2 to 2.13.3, martinmoene/optional-lite
    to 3.4.0, martinmoene/expected-lite to 0.5.0
- Updated translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), French (tkerdonc), German
    (Lysander Trischler), Italian (Mauro Scomparin), Polish (Carno), Russian
    (Alexander Batischev), Turkish (Emir SarÄ±), Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev)

### Fixed

    Schagt)
- Misleading error message when the urls file exists, but can't be opened (#439)
    (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Newsboat processing the leftovers of `stdin` after running `open-in-browser`
    operation (#26, #63, #1094) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `mark-feed-read` operation not marking articles as read on a remote service
    when the operation is invoked in the query feed (#220) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
- `run-on-startup` setting preventing Podboat from starting (#1288) (Dennis van
    der Schagt)
- `scrolloff` setting being ignored when opening a feed with lots of read
    articles before the unread one (#1293) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Memory corruption while rendering an article with JavaScript that contains
    HTML (#1300) (Alexander Batischev)
- Podboat help dialog crashing if `BACKSPACE` is bound (#1139) (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
- Being unable to run a second Newsboat instance with `--cache-file` switch if
    `cache-file` setting is used (#1318) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Misleading "an instance is already running" message when a lock file can't be
    created or written to (#314) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Failing to parse macros which contain semicolons in operations' arguments
    (#1200) (Alexander Batischev)
- Not installing some of the contrib scripts (Alexander Batischev)

- `scrolloff` setting which keeps the specified number of lines above and below
    the selected list item (#1103) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `%=[width][identifier]` formatting sequence for `*-format` settings. It
    centers a given value inside a given width, padded with spaces and slanting
    to the left if it can't be aligned evenly (Daniel Bauer)
- Support for Miniflux (#448) (Galen Abell)
- `run-on-startup` setting which executes a given list of operations when
    Newsboat starts. This can be used to e.g. open tag dialog on startup, or go

- In macros, no longer require a space between operation and the following
    semicolon (#702) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Sorting by first tag now ignores "title tags", i.e. the ones that start with

    Trischler), Polish (Carno), Russian (Alexander Batischev), Turkish (Emir
    SarÄ±), Ukrainian (Alexander Batischev)

### Fixed

- Nested lists being strung out into a single, non-nested list (#1158) (Dennis
    van der Schagt)
- Colons sometimes making filter expressions invalid (Alexander Batischev)
- Child processes that display notifications not being waited on. We now
    double-fork them (glacambre)
- Newsboat deleting all items of a feed when `cleanup-on-quit` is enabled (the
    default) and user moves from a search feed to a different feed with
    `next-unread` or `prev-unread` operations (#685) (Dennis van der Schagt)



## 2.20.1 - 2020-06-24

### Fixed
- Installation on BSDs (Tobias Kortkamp)
- Regression that caused Newsboat to require a space before semicolon in macros,
    which made `set browser "lynx"; open-in-browser` invalid (#1013, #1015,

- New format specifiers for `articlelist-format`: `%n` (article unread), `%d`
    (article deleted), `%F` (article's flags) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- New format specifier for `feedlist-title-format`,
    `articlelist-title-format`, and `searchresult-title-format`: `%F`, which
    contains current filter expression. That specifier is now included into
    those settings by default (#946) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- New setting, `switch-focus`, which specifies a key that moves the cursor
    between widgets in File- and DirBrowser (Dennis van der Schagt)
- New setting, `wrap-scroll`, which makes the cursor jump to the last item when
    scrolling up on the top one, and vice versa (David Pedersen)
- `exec` command-line command, which allows to run an arbitrary operation (#892)
    (Marco Sirabella)
- Dependency on martinmoene/optional-lite and martinmoene/expected-lite
    libraries, both of which we vendor

    without parameters (Alexander Batischev)
- It's now an error to have `macro` without at least two arguments (Alexander
    Batischev)
- The conditional format sequence (`%?[char]?[format]&[format]?`) now treats
    whitespace-only value as empty. This allows changing the formatting of, for
    example, "unread" and "deleted" fields in articlelist-format (Dennis van der
    Schagt)
- `open-in-browser-and-mark-read` in feedlist no longer marks articles read if
  the browser fails (Nikos Tsipinakis)
- Macro execution halts if one of the operations fails (Nikos Tsipinakis)
- Inoreader now marks articles read on a thread, to hide latency (#710)
    (pi.scateu.me)
- Bumped minimum supported Rust version to 1.40.0
- Updated vendored libraries: Catch2 to 2.12.2, json.hpp to 3.8.0

### Removed
- Newsboat's Inoreader API keys. Users need to register their own Inoreader
    application now, and set them via `inoreader-app-id` and `inoreader-app-key`
    settings. Please see "Inoreader" section in the HTML documentation for

    Schagt)
- `up`, `down`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `home`, and `end` now working in macros
    (#890) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Backslash inside double quotes requiring three escapes instead of one, every
    other time (#536, #642, #926) (Alexander Batischev)
- Users can bind operations to `UP`, `DOWN`, `HOME`, `END`, `NPAGE`, and `PPAGE`
    keys (#903) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Generate example config as part of `doc` target, so `install-examples` can
    simply copy it instead of generating (Alexander Batischev)
- Install manpages via `install-docs` target, not `install-newsboat` and
    `install-podboat` (#829) (Alexander Batischev)
- The wrong feed being opened (#72) turned out to be caused by a bug in libstfl.
    A patch for that library is available at
    https://github.com/dennisschagt/stfl/pull/4#issuecomment-613640246 (Dennis
    van der Schagt)



## 2.19 - 2020-03-22

Lists below only mention user-visible changes, but I would also like to
acknowledge contributions from the following people: Ivan Tham, Merlin BÃ¼ge,
Raphael Nestler, and Tobias Kortkamp.

This is the last release to support Rust 1.26.0. Starting with Newsboat 2.20,
we will be supporting only the last five stable Rust compilers (at the time of
the release), e.g. Newsboat 2.20 will only support Rust 1.40, 1.41, 1.42, 1.43,
1.44 (which should be the current stable at the time of Newsboat 2.20 release).
Please see https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat/issues/709 for more details on
this decision.

### Added
- contrib/urls-maintenance.sh: a script that converts HTTP to HTTPS, updates
    URLs according to HTTP redirects etc. (velaja)
- `delete-played-files` setting (#669) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- `%K` format for  `podlist-format`. This format specifier is replaced by the
  human readable download speed (automatically switches between KB/s, MB/s, and
  GB/s) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- Docs on how to synchronize with Bazqux (Jonathan Siddle, Alexander Batischev)
- Document that regexes use POSIX extended regular expressions
- Document that regexes in filter language are case-insensitive

### Changed
- Dependency: we now use Asciidoctor instead of Asciidoc
- Dependency on Rust: we now have a schedule for bumping the minimum supported
    Rust version (#709)
- Update vendored version of Catch2 to 2.11.3
- Display `<audio>` and `<video>` tags in article view (Ignacio Losiggio)
- Update translations: Dutch (Dennis van der Schagt), German (Lysander

    readable speed instead of always using KB/s) (#727) (Dennis van der Schagt)
- contrib/pinboard.pl: save description of the article (Donald Merand)
- The EOT markers ("~" characters below blocks of text) no longer inherit their
  style (colors + attributes) from the "article" style. Instead, they can be
  configured separately, allowing to hide them without hiding the article text
  (example config line: `color end-of-text-marker default default invis`) (#507)
  (Dennis van der Schagt)

### Fixed
- **Breaking change**: `bind-key` context `podbeuter` renamed to `podboat`
    (Alexander Batischev) (Kudos to Marcos Cruz)

    der Schagt created a patch and submitted it upstream on 7 March 2020, but
    the upstream maintainer haven't responded. Please apply the patch yourself:

## 2.18 - 2019-12-22

Lists below only mention user-visible changes, but I would also like to
acknowledge contributions from the following people: Simon Schuster, and seanBE.

### Added
- Logo by noobilanderi

### Changed
- `open-in-browser-and-mark-read` no longer marks item read if browser returned
    a non-zero exit code. Similarly, `open-all-unread-in-browser` and
    `open-all-unread-in-browser-and-mark-read` abort on non-zero exit code
    (Marco Sirabella)
- Update vendored version of Catch2 to 2.11.0
- Update vendored version of nlohmann/json to 3.7.3
- Update translations: German (Lysander Trischler), Russian, Ukrainian
    (Alexander Batischev)

    performance improvement we got in 2.17, but we haven't measured how much;
    it's guaranteed to not be any slower than 2.16.1 (Alexander Batischev)
- Failing to start if config contains `#` that doesn't start a comment, e.g.
    inside regular or filter expression (#652) (Alexander Batischev)

    Comments aren't really supported by Podboat since it overwrites the file
    from time to time, but the crash is still unacceptable (Nikos Tsipinakis)
- Newsboat displaying articles differently in "internal" and external pagers
    (Alexander Batischev)
- One-paragraph items not rendered at all (Alexander Batischev)
