By default, Newsboat stores all the files in a traditional Unix fashion, i.e.
in a "dotdir" located at _~/.newsboat_. However, it also supports a modern
way,
https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html[XDG Base Directory Specification],
which splits the files between the following locations:

1. _$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/newsboat/_ (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` defaults to _~/.config_)
2. _$XDG_DATA_HOME/newsboat/_ (`XDG_DATA_HOME` defaults to _~/.local/share_)

If the _newsboat_ directory exists under `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, then Newsboat will
use XDG directories (creating the data directory if necessary). Otherwise,
Newsboat will default to _~/.newsboat_.

If you're currently using _~/.newsboat/_ but wish to migrate to XDG
directories, you should move the files as follows:

_config_, _urls_::
        to _$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/newsboat/_

_cache.db_, _history.search_, _history.cmdline_, _queue_::
        to _$XDG_DATA_HOME/newsboat/_

Newsboat and Podboat also create "lock files". These prevent you from starting
two instances of the same program, and thus from corrupting your data. Newsboat
and Podboat remove these files when you quit the program, so there is no need
to copy them anywhere — just be aware of them in case you write scripts that
work with _cache.db_ or _queue_. By default, lock files are located as follows:

|===
||dotdir|XDG

|Newsboat
|_~/.newsboat/cache.db.lock_
|_$XDG_DATA_HOME/newsboat/cache.db.lock_

|Podboat
|_~/.newsboat/pb-lock.pid_
|_$XDG_DATA_HOME/newsboat/.lock_
|===

Newsboat places the lock file next to the cache file, so if you specify
<<cache-file,cache-file>> setting or pass `--cache-file` command-line argument,
the path to the lock file will change too. Podboat, on the other hand, always
places its lock file as shown above.
