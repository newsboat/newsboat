A podcast is a media file distributed over the internet using syndication feeds
such as RSS, for later playback on portable players or computers.
Newsboat supports downloading, saving and streaming podcasts, though an external
media player is needed for playback. This support differs a bit from other
podcast aggregators or "podcatchers" in how it is done.

Podcast content is transported in RSS feeds via special tags called
"enclosures". Newsboat recognizes these enclosures and stores the relevant
information for every podcast item it finds in an RSS feed. Since version 2.0,
it also recognizes and handles the Yahoo Media RSS extensions.

Remote APIs don't always list those "enclosures", so podcasts might be missing
from Newsboat. Such APIs are marked
<<#_Newsboat_as_a_client_for_newsreading_services,in the relevant section of our
docs>>. If a note is missing but you still don't see enclosures in Newsboat,
please file an issue and we'll get to the bottom of it!
