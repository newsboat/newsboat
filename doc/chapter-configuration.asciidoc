Several aspects of Newsboat can be configured via a _config_ file,
which is stored next to the _urls_ file.
A configuration line looks like this in general

`<config-command> <arg1> ...`

The configuration file can contain comments, which start with the `+#+` character and go as
far as the end of line.

****
*User contrib* Newsboat also comes with user contributed content like scripts and color
themes. The user contributed content can be found in
`/usr/share/doc/newsboat/contrib/`. End users are encouraged to take a look as
they may find something useful.
****

=== Example

An example configuration looks like this

----
# This is a comment
max-items 100 # Inline comments are possible, too
unbind-key R # Single argument config
bind-key ^R reload-all # Multi argument config
----


=== Using Double Quotes

****
*TL;DR* Use double quotes for strings that contain spaces or double quotes.
Escape double quotes (use \") and backslashes (use \\). Don't escape stuff
outside of double quotes, and don't use single quotes for quoting — Newsboat
doesn't support that.
****

Many of Newsboat's options expect strings as arguments, be it commands,
passwords, dialog titles, URLs etc. Some options even take _multiple_ strings
at once. These strings can contain spaces, which might confuse Newsboat since
it already uses spaces to separate option names from option arguments.

To help Newsboat understand your intent, put such strings into double quotes:

    browser "firefox --new-tab %u"

What if you need a double quote inside a string? Escape it with a backslash:

    ocnews-password "UnbalancedQuotes\"AreSoFun!"

And what about the backslash itself? Escape it, too! Suppose you have a program
called `my favourite pager`, and you want to view articles with it. Newsboat
ultimately passes commands to the shell, and shell expects spaces to be escaped
if you want them preserved. But since Newsboat interprets backslashes, you have
to add _another_ layer of escaping. Thus, you end up with a command like this:

    pager "/usr/bin/my\\ favourite\\ pager"


=== Shell Evaluation

It is also possible to integrate the output of external commands
into the configuration. The text between two `{backtick}` backticks is evaluated
as shell command, and its output is used. This works like backtick evaluation in
Bourne-compatible shells and allows users to use external information from the
system within the configuration.

=== Escaping

Backticks and `+#+` characters can be escaped with a backslash
(e.g. `{backslash}{backtick}` and `{backslash}#`).
In this case, they are replaced with literal `{backtick}` or `+#+` in the
configuration.

=== Key Bindings

You can bind a key to an operation with the <<bind-key,`bind-key`>> configuration command.
An example keybinding looks like this:

`bind-key <key> <operation> [<dialog>]`

*Key*

Lowercase keys, uppercase keys and special characters are written literally.

Key combinations with `Ctrl` are written using the caret `^`.
For instance `Ctrl-R` equals to `^R`.
Please be aware that all Ctrl-related key combinations need to be written in uppercase.

The following identifiers for special keys are supported:

- `ENTER` (Enter key)
- `BACKSPACE` (backspace key)
- `LEFT` (left cursor)
- `RIGHT` (right cursor)
- `UP` (up cursor)
- `DOWN` (down cursor)
- `PPAGE` (page up cursor)
- `NPAGE` (page down cursor)
- `HOME` (cursor to beginning of list/article)
- `END` (cursor to end of list/article)
- `ESC` (Esc key)
- `TAB` (Tab key)
- `F1` to `F12` (F1 key to F12 key)

*Operation*

An operation gets executed when pressing the corresponding key.
For a complete list of available operations see <<_newsboat_operations>> and <<_podboat_operations>>.

*Dialog*

A dialog is a context in which the key binding is active and is optional.
Available dialogs are:

* all (default if not specified)
* feedlist
* filebrowser
* help
* articlelist
* article
* tagselection
* filterselection
* urlview
* podboat
* dirbrowser

=== Colors

It is possible to configure custom color settings in Newsboat. The basic configuration
syntax is:

	color <element> <foreground color> <background color> [<attribute> ...]

This means that if you configure colors for a certain element, you need to provide
a foreground color and a background color as a minimum. The following colors are
supported:

- `black`
- `red`
- `green`
- `yellow`
- `blue`
- `magenta`
- `cyan`
- `white`
- `default`
- `color<n>`, e.g. `color123`

The `default` color means that the terminal's default color will be used. The
`color<n>` color name (where `<n>` is a decimal number *not* starting with zero)
can be used if your terminal supports 256 colors (e.g. `gnome-terminal`, or `xterm`
with `TERM` set to `xterm-256color`). Newsboat contains support for 256 color
terminals since version 2.1. For a complete chart of colors and their
corresponding numbers, please see
https://www.calmar.ws/vim/256-xterm-24bit-rgb-color-chart.html[].

Optionally, you can also add one or more attributes. The following attributes are
supported:

- `standout`
- `underline`
- `reverse`
- `blink`
- `dim`
- `bold`
- `protect`
- `invis`

Currently, the following elements are supported:

- `background`: the application background
- `listnormal`: a normal list item
- `listfocus`: the currently selected list item
- `listnormal_unread`: an unread list item
- `listfocus_unread`: the currently selected unread list item
- `title` (_added in 2.25_): current dialog's title, which is usually at the
  top of the screen (but see <<show-title-bar,`show-title-bar`>> and
  <<swap-title-and-hints,`swap-title-and-hints`>>). If you don't specify
  a style for this element, then the `info` style is used
- `info`: the hints bar, which is usually at the bottom of the screen (but see
  <<show-keymap-hint,`show-keymap-hint`>> and
  <<swap-title-and-hints,`swap-title-and-hints`>>)
- `hint-key` (_added in 2.25_): a key in the hints bar. If you don't specify
  a style for this element, then the `info` style is used
- `hint-keys-delimiter` (_added in 2.25_): the comma that separates keys in the
  hints bar. If you don't specify a style for this element, then the `info`
  style is used
- `hint-separator` (_added in 2.25_): the colon separating keys from their
  descriptions in the hints bar. If you don't specify a style for this element,
  then the `info` style is used
- `hint-description` (_added in 2.25_): a description of a key in the hints
  bar. If you don't specify a style for this element, then the `info` style is
  used
- `article`: the article text
- `end-of-text-marker`: filler lines (~) below blocks of text

The default color configuration of Newsboat looks like this:

	color background          white   black
	color listnormal          white   black
	color listfocus           yellow  blue   bold
	color listnormal_unread   magenta black
	color listfocus_unread    magenta blue   bold
	color title               yellow  blue   bold
	color info                yellow  blue   bold
	color hint-key            yellow  blue   bold
	color hint-keys-delimiter yellow  white
	color hint-separator      yellow  white  bold
	color hint-description    yellow  white
	color article             white   black
