After you've installed newsbeuter, you can run it for the first time by typing
"newsbeuter" on your command prompt. This will bring you the following message:

	Error: no URLs configured. Please fill the file /Users/ak/.newsbeuter/urls with RSS feed URLs or import an OPML file.

	newsbeuter 0.6
	usage: ./newsbeuter [-i <file>|-e] [-u <urlfile>] [-c <cachefile>] [-h]
		-r              refresh feeds on start
		-e              export OPML feed to stdout

This means that newsbeuter can't start without any configured feeds. To add
feeds to newsbeuter, you can either add URLs to the configuration file
$HOME/.newsbeuter/urls or you can import an OPML file by running "newsbeuter -i
blogroll.opml". To manually add URLs, open the file with your favorite text
editor and add the URLs, one per line:

	http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss
	http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_world_edition/front_page/rss.xml

If you need to add URLs that have restricted access via username/password, simply
provide the username/password in the following way:

	http://username:password@hostname.domain.tld/feed.rss

In order to protect username and password, make sure that
$HOME/.newsbeuter/urls has the appropriate permissions.

Now you can run newsbeuter again, and it will present you with a controllable
list of the URLs that you configured previously. You can now start downloading
the feeds, either by pressing "R" to download all feeds, or by pressing "r" to
download the currently selected feed. You can then select a feed you want to
read, and by pressing "Enter", you can go to the article list for this feed.
This works even while the downloading is still in progress.  You can now see
the list of available articles by their title. A "N" on the left indicates that
an article wasn't read yet. Pressing Enter brings you to the content of the
article. You can scroll through this text, and also run a browser (default:
lynx) to view the complete article if the content is empty or just an abstract
or a short description. Pressing "q" brings you back to the article list, and
pressing "q" again brings you back to the feed list. Pressing "q" a third time
then closes newsbeuter.

Newsbeuter caches the article that it downloads. This means that when you start
newsbeuter again and reload a feed, the old articles can still be read even if
they aren't in the current RSS feeds anymore. Optionally you can configure how
many articles shall be preserved by feed so that the article backlog doesn't
grow endlessly (see below).

Several aspects of newsbeuter's behaviour can be configured via a configuration
file, by default $HOME/.newsbeuter/config. This configuration files contains
lines in the form "<config-command> <arg1> ...".  The configuration file can
also contain comments, which start with the '#' character and go as far as the
end of line. If you need to enter a configuration argument that contains
spaces, use quotes (") around the whole argument.

Searching for articles is possible in newsbeuter, too. Just press the "/" key,
enter your search phrase, and the title and content of all articles are
searched for it. When you do a search from the list of feeds, all articles of
all feeds will be searched. When you do a search from the article list of a
feed, only the articles of the currently viewed feed are searched.
