What the user can do is to add the podcast download URL to a download queue.
Alternatively, Newsboat can be configured to automatically do that. This
queue is stored in the _queue_ file next to the _cache.db_ file.

The user can then use the download manager `Podboat` to download these files
to a directory on the local filesystem. Podboat comes with the Newsboat
package, and features a look and feel very close to the one of Newsboat. It
also shares the same configuration file.

Podcasts that have been downloaded but haven't been played yet remain in the
queue but are marked as downloaded. You can remove them by purging them from
the queue with the kbd:[Shift+P] key. After you've played a file and close Podboat, it
will be removed from the queue. The downloaded file remains on the
filesystem unless "delete-played-files" is enabled.

A common "use case" is to configure Newsboat to automatically enqueue newly
found podcast download URLs. Then, the user reloads the podcast RSS feeds in
Newsboat, and after that, uses Podboat to view the current queue, and
either selectively download certain files or automatically download them all
together by pressing kbd:[A] within Podboat.
