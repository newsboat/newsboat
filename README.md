Newsboat is an RSS/Atom feed reader for the text console. It's an actively
maintained fork of Newsbeuter.

A feed reader pulls updates directly from sites like blogs and news agencies,
and lets you review them in a single interface. Many times, the feed includes
the full text of the update, so you don't even need to start a web browser! You
can learn more about feed readers [on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator).

Dependencies
------------

Newsboat depends on a number of libraries, which need to be installed before
Newsboat can be compiled.

<!--
    UPDATE doc/newsboat.asciidoc IF YOU CHANGE THIS LIST
-->
- GCC 5.0 or newer, or Clang 3.6 or newer
- Stable [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) and Cargo (Rust's package
    manager) (1.48.0 or newer; might work with older versions, but we don't
    check that)
- [STFL (version 0.21 or newer)](http://www.clifford.at/stfl/)
- [SQLite3 (version 3.5 or newer)](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
- [libcurl (version 7.21.6 or newer)](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
- Header files for the SSL library that libcurl uses. You can find out which
    library that is from the output of `curl --version`; most often that's
    OpenSSL, sometimes GnuTLS, or maybe something else.
- GNU gettext (on systems that don't provide gettext in the libc):
  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gettext/
- [pkg-config](https://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/wiki/)
- [libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html)
- [json-c (version 0.11 or newer)](https://github.com/json-c/json-c/wiki)
- [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/) (1.5.3 or newer)
- Some implementation of AWK like [GNU AWK](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk) or [NAWK](https://github.com/onetrueawk/awk).

Developers will also need:

- [xtr (version 0.1.4 or newer)](https://github.com/woboq/tr) (can be installed
    with `cargo install xtr`)
- [Coco/R for C++](http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/coco/), needed to re-generate
    filter language parser using `regenerate-parser` target.

Installation
------------

<!--
    UPDATE doc/newsboat.asciidoc IF YOU CHANGE THIS LIST
-->

There are numerous ways:

- install from your distribution's repository ([a lot of distros have
    a package](https://repology.org/project/newsboat));

- install via [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd):

      $ sudo snap install newsboat

  Our snap [only supports `xdg-open` as the browser][snap-browser], and you
  can't run arbitrary scripts for rendering and bookmarking. The reason is
  strict confinement; if we disabled it, the snap would be no better than
  a distribution's package;

  [snap-browser]: https://newsboat.org/releases/2.23/docs/faq.html#_regarding_newsboat_snap_installations

- [build from source with Docker](doc/docker.md). Note that the resulting binary
    might not run outside of that same Docker container if your system doesn't
    have all the necessary libraries, or if their versions are too old;

- build from source in a chroot: to avoid polluting your system with developer
    packages, or to avoid upgrading, you might use a tool like
    [`debootstrap`](https://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap) to create an isolated
    environment. Once that's done, just build from source as outlined in the
    next item;

- build from source.

    Install everything that's listed in the "Dependencies" section above. Make
    sure to install the header files as well (on Debian and derivatives, headers
    are in `-dev` packages, e.g. `libsqlite3-dev`.)

    Cross-compilers need to set `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET`; see [cargo
    documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#environment-variables).

    Then compile and install with:

      $ make                   #  pass -jN to use N CPU cores, e.g. -j8
      $ sudo make install      #  install everything under /usr/local

    To install to a different directory, pass `prefix` like so: `sudo make
    prefix=/opt/newsboat install`.

    To uninstall, run `sudo make uninstall`.
